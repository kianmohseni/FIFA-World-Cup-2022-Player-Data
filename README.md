# Project Overview

This project analyzes player performance data from the 2022 FIFA Men's World Cup, using machine learning techniques and data visualization to identify key patterns and predictive insights. The datasets include detailed metrics such as goals, assists, touches, passes, tackles, and yellow cards, providing a comprehensive view of player performance on soccer's biggest stage.

As a passionate soccer enthusiast, I chose these datasets for their relevance and recency, as the 2022 FIFA World Cup was a personal favorite. By leveraging tools like Scikit-learn and Matplotlib, this project explores the predictive power of various player attributes and performance indicators.

# Datasets Used
- Player Statistics: Individual performance metrics.
- Player Possession: Ball possession data.
- Player Passing: Passing accuracy and volume.
- Player Defense: Defensive actions and contributions.

# Dataset Sources
The datasets were curated and merged from public FIFA analytics platforms and cleaned for the analysis.

# Tools and Libraries
The analysis and modeling leverage the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- NumPy: Numerical computations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models and metrics

# Methods
Key analytical steps included:

1. Merging and preprocessing the four datasets to create a unified dataset with relevant features.
2. Feature engineering and filtering to retain critical attributes such as goals, assists, xG (expected goals), and passing statistics.
3. Model training using Scikit-learn algorithms, including Decision Trees and Random Forests.
   
Example code snippet:

```ruby
# Fit the classifier on the training data
clf_1.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Generate predictions for train and test sets
predictions_train = clf_1.predict(X_train)
predictions_test = clf_1.predict(X_test)
```

# Key Findings

1. A playerâ€™s position can be predicted based on the areas of the field where they have the most touches.
2. The "expected goals" (xG) feature effectively predicts actual goals scored.
3. Teams with higher passing frequencies are more likely to succeed in tournaments.

# Limitations

While the findings are insightful, they are specific to the 2022 FIFA Men's World Cup and may not generalize to other tournaments or contexts. Factors like weather, referee decisions, match importance (group vs. knockout stages), and data accuracy were not fully addressed.

# Results

This project demonstrates how sports analytics can uncover patterns and create predictive models, enhancing understanding and decision-making in professional soccer.
